# Logical-Thinking-Location-Based-Project-in-San-Francisco

The focus of this assignment is analyzing the arguments by making strong applications of all the logical thinking frameworks. However, one initial challenge is to identify the arguments within the ads to begin with. What argument is the ad trying to make? The arguments will not be completely spelled out for me! I'll have to translate the advertisement into an argument with clear premises and a conclusion, including any hidden/implicit prepositions.
